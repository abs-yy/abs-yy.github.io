## Cellular stress 
Living organisms are exposed to various stresses throughout their life cycles. They have evolved various mechanisms to protect themselves from the damage, or repair sustained damage. Various organisms have evolved tolerance against [extreme environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile); *i.e.* environemnts that we humans normally do not encounter at a daily basis. Commonly known environemnts are: High and low temperature (Thermophiles, Psychrophiles), acidic and alkaline (Acidophile, Alkaliphile), aigh and low pressures (Piezophile), salt conditions (Halophile), metal ions (Metallotolerant), osmotic pressure (Osmophile), radiation (Radioresistant), and desiccation (Xerophile). Cells constantly affected by these environments require molecular mechanisms to endure and proliferate; studying these mechanisms allow us to understand the robustness cells have.
