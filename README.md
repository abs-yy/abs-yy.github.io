## Cellular stress 
  Living organisms are exposed to various stresses throughout their life cycles. They have evolved various mechanisms to protect themselves from the damage, or repair sustained damage. Various organisms have evolved tolerance against [extreme environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile); *i.e.* environemnts that we humans normally do not encounter at a daily basis. Commonly known environemnts are: High and low temperature (Thermophiles, Psychrophiles), acidic and alkaline (Acidophile, Alkaliphile), aigh and low pressures (Piezophile), salt conditions (Halophile), metal ions (Metallotolerant), osmotic pressure (Osmophile), radiation (Radioresistant), and desiccation (Xerophile). Cells constantly affected by these environments require molecular mechanisms to endure and proliferate; studying these mechanisms allow us to understand the robustness cells have.
  Famous extremophiles are bacterial species, such as the radiotolerant Deinococcus radiodurans<sup>1</sup>, capable of tolerating >5000 Gy gamma rays. Single cell organisms, compaired to multi-cell species, have relatively higher tolerance since they do not have tissues comprised from differentiated cells. However, several species have been reported to have high capabilites compaired to general eukaryotes. 

## Tardigrades 
  We have been focusing on the ecdyozoan animal, Tardigrades. Terrestrial Tardigrade species are famous for their capabiliteis of tolerating complete desiccation, a phenonemon called anhydrobiosis. Anhydrobiosis is on of a latent state of life (Cryptobiosis); others include cryobiosis (low tempretures), anoxybiosis (low oxigen levels), osmobiosis (Osmotic pressure), and Chemobiosis (high levels of toxins), which tardigrades are capable of entering all states. Anhydrobiotic individuals are known to tolerate various environmental states, i.e. high and low pressures and tempreture, alchohols, ultraviolet lights, radiation, and even vacumue space. 
  As tardigrades are a "non-model organism", studies on these organisms were limited to zoological and ecological methods. The first rearing method for tardigrades were established at 2009 by Atsushi Suzuki for the *Milneisum tardigradum* (currently *Milnesium inseptum*), and was followed by Daiki D. Horikawa for *Ramazzottius varieornatus*. Establishment of rearing methods enabled more sophisticated studies, such as omics analysis. One of the first omics based studies were conducted on *R. varieornatus* and had identified several tardigrade specific anhydrobiosis related genes. Now, the genome and transcriptome assemblies  have been published. These data have allowed a phylum-wide analysis of the conservation of anhydrobiosis related genes.
